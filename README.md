# PCrypt

An esoteric programming language that allows users to encrypt
and decrypt data through image processing.

In other words...

Coding for artists! Users can visualize complicated code
as colored pixel patterns. Images both created with PCrypt or not
can be translated back to data. There is also an option
for users to "draw" with pixels to create an encoded image.
